The final project for the Foundations section of The Odin Project: A functioning web calculator!

This one was interesting for sure! Keeping all the variables in check proved more challenging than I thought (despite the assignment saying that it would be the hardest part). I attempted the extra credit task of implementing the decimal point, and at that point I realized how unwieldy my current solution is. As it stands, I've foregone the extra credit tasks for now, but would like to return to them later.
